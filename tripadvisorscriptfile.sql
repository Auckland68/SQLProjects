VALUES
(1,'DO NOT EAT THEY SERVE RAW CHICKEN','Stay away from Havant tandoori. When phoned and complained that the chicken is clearly raw they argued and said that they cook there chicken so it is pink'),
(2, 'Breakfast','What a wonderful place. The atmosphere is so good with all the furniture and items from the era. There are paper cuttings and objects to read and look at. The food and staff are excellent. We went for the Lancaster breakfast which was excellent value and cooked perfectly.'),
(3, 'Another lovely lunchtime','Another lovely lunch time meal and drinks at this unique café. The staff are always polite and attentive and cater for food allergens. The coffee was delicious - not bitter like other cafes. Panini with sides was delicious too and perfectly toasted. My husband had a toastie that was cooked just the way he requested. Prices were appropriate for the food quality and service we received. Thank you everyone once again for a lovely experience. 10/10'),
(4, 'Apart from disappointing brekki I rate it 10/10','Thought breakfast expensive for what u get not keen on sausages at all. Lovely lovely people lovely place just think brekki needs looking at'),
(5, 'Ripped off','I booked 3 Adults and one child for afternoon tea. I got questioned over the age of the child who is 11. Only realising today that the child portion was charged as an adults. I was not informed at the payment that this was going to happen. Clearly a child of 11 is not a child any longer. Will not be returning'),
(6, 'A great spot!','A great spot for some breakfast & coffee with a cosy atmosphere, as well as good service. A wonderful place to stop by and check out.'),
(7, 'Profit over service. Shoddy meal and response.','Shocking experience. Two of us ordered award winning pies which came with absolutely NO MEAT (v tasty gravy tbf!). Staff said someone else had complained also. Asked for the manager who said it was a supplier problem not the pub’s. Tried to make recompense by offering a portion of another meal. But had to be less in value, could not give a free drink for eg. So with beef gravy one had some scampi pieces, another had gammon strips fried up. In this view should have replaced the entire meal or offered a free drink etc. not our fault the supplier had messed up. Shocking handling of a valid and polite complaint. And a lime and soda at £2.75? Profit over service here.'),
(8, 'Beautiful location shame about the pub!','Great location have been many times over the years as local but will not be going again! Decor dated, female toilets disgusting, one broken the other toilet roll holder broken and toilet roll on the floor. We were sat at a window table but asked to move due to flies gathered all over the window and a hole in the top filled with a cloth and masking tape! On top of that what I can only describe as children running up and down in the room above us all night - very noisy! Such a shame, food not great either beautiful location what a waste!'),
(9, 'A great location let down by the chef','A lovely location and a lovely sunny day, unfortunately the food gets a NO. The Mediterranean vegetables in the Halloumi wrap were over done and the chorizo on the king prawn risotto was over cooked and crisp!'),
(10, 'Great location but...',"Great location but overall, disappointed with the food and service. There was no skimping on portions and this may have led us to not having so much of an appetite after the starters. That said, the starters seemed to take an age to reach us - and the pub wasn't really that busy. The squid was rather tasteless so, even though there was loads of it, it wasn't the best I'd ever had. My partner, however, loved the baked mini camembert and the copious amount of garlic focaccia that came with it. After another long wait the mains arrived; thus far, no-one has asked what we thought of the meals nor, indeed, whether or not we had any allergies. Her salad was loaded with rocket which she can't eat. They were asked to make sure there was none on the plate but apparently, this was not doable. The halloumi, on the other hand, was good. I had a huge beef and ale pie which, whilst lacking in chunks of beef, was hot, tasty and filled with a delicious gravy. The buttered mash however, was a small lump of dry stuff which tasted only slightly better when soaked in the gravy. The brocolli was limp and rather tasteless too. So, lovely place and great portions but otherwise, disappointing."),
(11, 'Great atmosphere and food','Lovely pub and great food. I had the Katsu chicken curry which i can highly recommend, and the others had the steak and ale pie which they said was delicious. We have been before and have never beendisappointed. We just want to thank Michael and irina (hopefully correct spelling) for making our visit a memorable one. Both of them were so welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. Our Niece was visiting from Canada and loved it. 😍'),
(12, 'Business','Came back here to visit for a work meeting. Again greeted by Mike, he was professional yet funny. Made for a real lighthearted meeting. Definitely be holding work lunches here more often. Also the view are incredible. Thank you Mike'),
(13, 'A Nice choice for a family meal','The food was lovely, a good selection and what we chose was well prepared and presented. The pub was busy and a little understaffed so the service was a little slow through no fault of the staff who worked hard to keep up with demand. They were attentive and polite. It was good value for money too which is always welcomed'),
(14, 'Recommend','We were really pleased with the meal. The waiter - Mike- was extremely helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Difficult to fault, great view, lovely food very welcoming'),
(15, 'Lovely','Stopped in for some drinks and ended up having dinner! Food was lovely and so were the views. Will be back again. All the staff were nice, Michael especially who was chatty and got us trying new drinks.'),
(16, 'Happy Experience',"Just wanted to share mine and my daughter's experience today, The Royal Oak is a gorgeous pub / restaurant in a fabulous location and also has very welcoming team behind bar and front oh house. However today they now have very friendly funny and professional Mike and lovely smiley Lou considering they were busy bar service was smooth and quickish and lunch was very quick it was what it said on the tin wholesome and filling . Thank you all and well done on employing people with people qualities and good customer service skills. We will be back very soon and recommend friends to visit too. Kind regards nicky and Holly xx"),
(17, 'Lovely lunch spot with hound.','Great food with good vegan options, friendly service and doggy treats from the manager, Micheal. Will be back for a visit again soon.'),
(18, 'Lovely friendly pub','Beautiful pub on the shoreline on Langstone. On arrival greeted by great barman then over to lovely Mike with a smile. It seemed our booking didn’t go through due to new system change over, no problem at all Mike went all out to make sure we still got our table. Gluten Free menu with delicious choices for myself, very impressed. Friends enjoyed their meal with great value too. Mike gave the pub a great vibe always asking if everything was ok and saw to our needs! I must say he is a true credit to your local pub thank you The Royal Oak, highly recommend 4 happy ladies !!'),
(19, 'Great service','I had a lovely afternoon in the beer garden. The service was service, and the bartenders were very friendly, especially Mike!'),
(20, 'Fathers Day','Was taken to the old house at home , havant for Father’s Day , had an excellent roast dinner, with amazing staff who were very attentive and polite . Would highly recommend and will be back soon .'),
(21, 'Lovely old pub with a friendly atmosphere','I have been to this pub several times now and the staff are friendly and welcoming, especially Amie the manager. The food is good and the building itself has a lot of character due to its 400 year age, along with a nice pub garden to sit in during the summer months. The Bands/ singers they have on a Saturday night get a lot of people dancing and the atmosphere is really good The Sunday dinners by the way are amazing!!'),
(22, 'Friendly and welcoming','Friendly staff and a great selection of beer. Euros available to watch and live music on a Friday!! Prices not too bad considering.'),
(23, 'Awful','In my honest opinion, this pub is still a far stretch from where it should be. My partner ordered pork belly which was anything but tender. The burger I ordered was ok but totally basic. It’s also very expensive, £17+ for two drinks. I don’t think the bar staff are particularly professional. There was no effort to do any St George’s day celebrations, staff were not even aware of it. Our last visit was the worst, chairs had been left out in the rain overnight and had been put back around a table, nice and ready for unsuspecting customers to park themselves, (which we did), resulting in wet trousers all around. Although we received a round of drinks, this was the last straw for us. We will not be returning to this pub for a very long time. Fullers need to take this pub back and sort it out!!'),
(24, 'Fast & Easy','Easy drive through, accessible, ordered on the app prior to arrival. Food was made hot considering it was quiet at the venue. Quick and easy!'),
(25, 'The best breakfast in town!','INCREDIBLE!! We go in here often and the service is the best around, the best breakfast I have ever had! The owner always takes his time to walk around and say hello to everyone and you can tell the staff care about everyone especially their regulars.'),
(26, 'Cheap and cheerful','Lovely food and service from Louise. Great value. Had mix up grill with chicken and the jerk chicken and wings platter. Can’t go wrong at the Heron Thank you.'),
(27, 'Lunch in the sun','Had a lovely lunch, nice food in the sun. Brilliant service from louise, nice chilled atmosphere. Obviously shall be back'),
(28, 'Good food good atmosphere','Good for a cheap meal with the family but still great service, thanks from harlee, kayleigh and kaylee for an amazing experience'),
(29, 'Friday lunch','Lovely lunch, great atmosphere, staff attentive and knowledgeable! Decent price so doesn’t break the bank! Definitely worth a visit!'),
(30, '10/10','Food was great as always, welcoming and friendly staff, ash was very helpful with me and my family and welcoming would highly recommend'),
(31, 'Pub lunch','Visited today with 2 friends we opted for the baguettes and fries and a cheeky cider in the pub garden! The food was hot and filled with flavour. Our server Harley was very attentive and polite and even recommended the donut pudding!'),
(32, 'Thank you Heron!','I visited on Sunday evening for the England match as I came here before for football and the atmosphere is amazing! The heron didn’t disappoint, all staff happy and smiling! Credit to Faith and Yvonne for upselling me anything and everything every time I approached the bar! I’ll be back for sure! 🙂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿'),
(33, 'Closing','Such a shame once again lovely evening with really wonderful staff and good food and they are closing soon will be missed'),
(34, 'Great food, great venue but…..','To repeat the previous two comments that the five of us had a very enjoyable and impromptu dinner this early evening served by Will. Grandchildren ate what they ordered which was a pleasant surprise for us. We have been going to this venue for more than 20 years and are so disappointed that it is closing in less than two weeks time. Shame on the group for removing such a popular venue. We travel extensively in the USA and know what eating houses are like. We do not want McDonald’s all the time but are being forced to choose less appropriate places to eat.  Read less'),
(35, 'Great service','Will our was so attentive from start to finish. Checking on us during the meal to ensure everything was satisfactory can’t praise him enough food was good and fairly priced. Shame the venue is closing down.'),
(36,'Good Roast Dinner', 'Visited the Rusty cutter with family for lunch, had the roast beef which was lovely. Served by Will who was friendly and efficient as always. Would recommend a lovely roast dinner good quality food and value for money.'),
(37, 'Evening meal 5 stars breakfast 2.5',"We used the restaurant for our overnight stay with our three year old and the same as the previous year we had two contrasting meals. The evening meal was excellent. The food was a good amount, hot, tasted really good and a great selection on the menu. The breakfast wasn't the worst I've ever had but not brilliant. The beans had a skin on and were cold not even warm, the bacon was inedible as it was that cold and hard it was like leather, my poached eggs were perfect but the sausages again were warm not hot. We had more bacon and beans to replace the ones we couldn't eat but they were the same again. A good selection for the continental breakfast but would be good if there were decaf options which there weren't that day. Staff were busy but attentive for both meals and helpful when needed especially making sure our son was seen to."),
(38, 'Great Visit',"Went here for Fathers day, served by Will. Great service and great food as always. Ridiculous that they're closing this place down - terrible decision"),
(39, 'Great food and service', "Had a wonderful meal with family of 7 for Fathers Day. Waiting staff (Will) was amazing and although they were busy the food arrived in good time and was great value for money. Shame if this closes to public as we often eat here and the food and staff are always great."),
(40, 'Good','Shame it’s going. Went for a Father’s Day lunch with family. Had good food and service from Will. Had lovely breakfast especially with children'),
(41, 'Our go to for the last 10 years','Great value for money meals and great midweek night out. Been coming here for the last 10 years and staff have always been great. Always recieved extra money of vouchers too'),
(42, 'Birthday meal',"We booked a table for 1600 arrived and admit we were 5 minutes late howevervtable wasn't ready would have understood if busy but lots of empty tables we went to the bar and served by a very miserable male then sat down to eat. We had a3 year old and an 18 month old with us. Will was our server we had a voucher for 40% off main meals and my daughter whose birthday had a free birthday meal voucher on her rewards usually you cannot use two together so my daughter checked first with the manager who told her she could. We have an awkward order for Will and he got it right however it took nearly an hour for our mains to come out others in restaurant served and gone before us and we had to ask for refills twice before they came 15 mins after the last time of asking. We ordered more chips unlimited and by the time they came we had finished our meals they took ages. I have To comment on Wills attitude you could tell he was angry with us for some reason and the service lacked totally from him. I had asked for a pancake for the two children as they were getting noisy as you imagine that age you have a time frame for keeping them occupied 20 minutes passed still had not arrived my daughter whose children they were stopped will and said don't worry about the pancake got to go then when they had coats on he brought the pancakes out but obviously too late. Then will did the bill forgetting to take the free birthday meal voucher. We always leave a 12.5% tip however due to the lack of customer service did not leave one. The food was ok for 5 of us but the birthday meal the food was cold No point in complaining at the time as we could not catch wills attention. Felt I had to put on the review"),
(43, 'Love this Beefeater!','Always an amazing meal here and the staff are always friendly. Super quick service and prices are very good. Well worth being a loyalty member too as easy to collect points for money off. Which my local Beefeater was as good as this 1.'),
(44, 'Mixed Grill',"Please don't close this beefeater to locals. It's a sad day. But had a fantastic mixed grill and a few beers. Brilliant service even though the staff will be out of a job soon."),
(45, 'Great place to eat','Popped in for our son’s birthday dinner. Food was great, tasty and hot. Drinks good and service by Lisa was excellent… very friendly and welcoming. Will be back again!'),
(46, 'Sad to hear of soon to be closed','We love this restaurant . It is very good value for money . Very good for meeting up with family . Breakfast always brilliant and freshly topped up. Very upset to hear we will not be able to use soon . It’s perfectly placed for all the locals .'),
(47, 'A great night out','A relaxing evening as always. The food was excellent value with a reasonable choice and good quality food. We received exceptional service from Will.'),

(52, 'Birthday celebration at The Rusty Cutter',"Visited the Rusty Cutter to celebrate a Birthday. The food arrived hot and was absolutely delicious 😋 Will, our waiter, was attentive, polite and cheerful. As my main course steak was so tasty I decided to order pud - New York Style Cheesecake, and I'm so glad I did 😋 All together a very enjoyable evening and I left feeling happy and full. Thanks Will for looking after us so well 🌟"),
(53, 'Rubbish',"I am really disappointed Having been here many times and I’ve rated it above the ones in Emsworth etc To be let down was very upsetting I ordered after walking in ….ok My food arrived in Literally 2 minutes HOW When I got home 5 minute drive the food was only warm and lacking in flavour The crispy chilli beef wasn’t it was soft It all felt like it had been cooked in the microwave 😡"),
(54, 'Not great',"After waiting an hour and a half, called restaurant, to be told would be another 10 minutes. Food arrived, chow mein luke warm, other items warm, not hot or to temperature. Ordered Singapore noodles , not given just mixed noodle. Very disappointed, didn't call restaurant as was a pre mothers day meal that my son brought for me."),
(55, 'Great Value Wednesday’s',"Always good food . Exceptional value on Wednesday banquet night. Any Starter, Main, Side, Rice or Nan, Coffee. £15.95."),
(56, 'Garbage - Worst Indian meal in over 70 years',"The food and service in this restaurant used to be very good indeed - but I haven't been there since Covid and I think that management/ownership must have changed. There is not a single good word I can say about it.The service was very average and the food was appalling. The papadams were so thin that they literally fragmented in your fingers - you couldn't really use them to hold the various chutneys that came with them. I think that some of the meats had been pre-cooked and put aside to be added to various dishes as they were ordered. Every part/piece of the mixed tandoori starter was overdone and as tough as boots. The chicken tikka was the same, whilst that in the korma tasted as if it had been cooked separately (earlier?) and simply covered in the warmed sauce for presentation/service. My own Jalfrezi - supposedly semi hot - was absolutely tasteless.I was born and have lived for many years in the Far East before coming home to UK, so I know what a good curry should taste like. I have had many excellent ones in this country. - But NOT at Red Chilli. The whole meal was honestly the WORST curry I (and my friends) have ever experienced. None of us will ever go back there again!!!"),
(57, 'A decent pot of tea','The service was prompt and the staff were polite saying good morning when I walked in. I bought a pot of Tea which was nice and hot and was the right strength whereby it had a lot of flavour without being too strong.'),
(58, 'Best for food in Havant','GDK is by far the best option for food in Havant (which has a lot of choices). The place is clean, staff are friendly and food is amazing.'),
(59, 'The standard coffee thing…','Standard Costa coffee shop. Selling all the standard items, some had run out. Staff friendly, coffee quick, all the usual?'),
(60, 'Awful food','Delivery turned up an hour late. Food was terrible meat was chewy and also the pappdoms was also soft and soggy. Meal ended up in the bin. Worst meal that we have ever had'),
(61, 'Would definitely come back food was delicious,very fast service','I rate this a very good service from the drive thru I was served fast and food was hot, tia was very polite would definitely come back .'),
(62, 'Cheap beer', 'Well, be prepared, it’s rough. I wouldn’t eat in here and the staff look like they’d punch you if you complained about anything. Toilets were clean. Beer is cheap 2 pints £6'),
(63, 'Null Pois','What a god-forsaken dump...Tim Martin is in serious trouble if this sorry place is a reflection of his idea of the hospitality industry. Tepid, nuked food served on cold plates by surly waiting staff. Filthy chairs and tables. . Cleanliness.....0 Ambiance.....0 Food...........0 Service.......0'),
(64, 'Don’t buy from these robbing companies','Very disappointed with this place I brought two meal deals cod and chips large yes the cod was large ok but I’ve had more cod in a fish finger the whole thing was batter and very little fish and the chips were covered in salt😡 there only thing going for this meal was the drink which they didn’t mess up £18.99 each. We the people are struggling to get through life as it is and when we treat our selfs we get ripped of by our local chippy I hope they lose there business soon greedy beggers. I should of got some pictures but I was so angry I just threw away😡'),
(65, 'Family Sunday Lunch for Fathers Day','We were a party of 16 for Fathers Day Sunday lunch. The booking was easy to make with quick responses to emails. On arrival we were given a really friendly greeting by all the staff but we would particularly like to thank the 2 girls that served us and went out of their way to ensure we had a good experience. Everyone in our party was really happy with their lunches. I wish I had got the name of the 2 girls as they should really have a big pat on the back for all their hard work, not just for our party but they worked so hard all the time we were there and always had a smile on their faces.'),
(66, "Father's Day meal",'Had a lovely family meal. Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly staff. Food was excellent Looking forward to trying more of their menu soon'),
(67, 'Meal at the Wheelwrights','Great place to meet with friends for supper, good ambience and outstanding service from the front of house and bar staff.'),
(68, 'Very good',"I recently visited for lunch and a roast in a week and both were excellent. Both times I started with the prawn cocktail and it was very good. Big juicy prawns with plenty of sauce, fresh salad and bread.. My roast beef was perfectly cooked and I think the carrot was the best I've eaten. The chicken, ham and leek pie was lovely with a wonderful buttery smooth mash."),
(69, 'Good Sunday roast','This is our local and we usually pop in for Happy Hour a few times a month and have Sunday roast now and again. Roast is very good and plentiful and the service is always excellent. After our meal, we wanted to sit outside but unfortunately, both of the outside areas are also smoking/vaping areas, so we had to stay indoors. It would be great if just one of the outside areas could be smoke free. I was used to ordering a large Sauvignon blanc which was about £9.00 per glass (Petal and Stem), so when I ordered my wine yesterday, I didn’t notice any change in the taste and presumed it was Petal and Stem, when we paid the bill we were both shocked to see that the large glass of wine was £14.95 per glass. The wine has now changed to New Zealand ‘Frost Pocket” which retails at £12 per bottle. I appreciate there is always a mark up but £14.95 per glass is quite shocking. Going to have Happy Hour at home instead from now on but will be back for Sunday Roast.'),
(70, 'Lucky us “ it’s our local”','Really lovely spontaneous lunch. Weather for May dreadful 🤷‍♀️ Wheelwrights welcoming, warm and food hit the spot. Managed to intercept the lovely chef and Thank her personally , staff ( Cerys & Jo) very attentive, without being intrusive, a credit to their profession. They have found the perfect balance here at the wheelwrights, whether front of house or behind the scene all the well oiled cogs make the wheels go round here at the wheelwrights ( no pun intended) Fantastic local for us. Thank you everyone.'),

The mash on both pies was cold and was sent back. however when the meals returned the mash was warm at one end cold at other. What type of chef does not check the temperature of the food served. Food sent back .paid for starters and drinks then left. Very very disappointed."),

Welder was Very helpful on the phone and booked us a table for 3. Service was excellent throughout by Welder and Yana. Sirloin Roast looked and tasted really good.'),
(123, 'Terrible customer service!',"Having previously had a good experience, my 90 year old mum and I went for lunch. We ordered prawn salads with falafel and humus from the menu. The last two items were missing on our plates, but when queried we were told that nobody ordered those so they didn't have any! We asked for an alternative and were given half a slice of bread each! I then found a hair in my salad, but when I reported this, I was told that the kitchen staff had dark hair so it wasn't theirs! I was too stunned to reply! Then I was told we couldn't expect a refund, because the hair wasn't theirs. I explained we didn't want a refund, just an apology. Never again!"),
(124, 'Disappointing!',"Very disappointed after waiting nearly an hour for a cheese scone I ordered that didn't appear, I ordered this as I was in a hurry. Its annoying when someone after you orders a jacket potato then receives their order before you!!! I won't be coming back!!"),
(125, 'Perfect light lunch','Popped for a quick lunch when out shopping with Mum. A little busy, but got lucky with a table just leaving as we arrived. Quick drinks and a little wait for the food. But when you know it’s fresh and independent you don’t mind waiting. It was well worth the wait. Good portions, hot and full of flavour. Emma (the name on the receipt) was spot on, attentive and friendly. We will definitely be back');
